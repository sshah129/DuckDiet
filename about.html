            <p class="about">College students are often burdened by the overwhelming amount of choices for food when they first start college.
              This dilemma often leads to unhealthy choices for meals, causing common problems such as weight gain, lack of exercise, laziness, and more.
            </p>
            <p class="about">Duck Diet serves to create an efficient and simple way for Stevens students to track their meals through an online meal planner,
              to promote better self-care, wellness, and organization. The goal is to help students build better habits towards improving their
              wellness and nutritional health by automatically setting goals for students.
